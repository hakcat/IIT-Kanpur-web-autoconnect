# IIT-Kanpur-web-autoconnect
Simple script using webdriver to automatically keep iit kanpur web service alive
My windows lab pc has issues with the connectivity and automatically internet goes off even if the tab is kept open.
SO this script used to work for me. You can go ahead and schedule it even as a task with priority to even work if you lock the system and go.
